<h1>Overview: Sandstorm Sandcats</h1>

<p>Sandstorm is a platform for server-oriented and web-based applications. Sandstorm the platform is open source; anyone can run Sandstorm on their own personal server hardware. When you run Sandstorm on your own hardware, you can do anything you want with it: Sandstorm the platform is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license which places no restrictions on usage.</p>

<p>Sandstorm the company (Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.) also offers a DNS service called Sandcats. Sandcats makes it easy to obtain a hostname and TLS certificate for your personal Sandstorm server, as a subdomain of sandcats.io. Sandstorm owns the domain sandcats.io but delegates a subdomain, such as "example.sandcats.io", to you for free. The purpose of the service is to make it easy for you and your friends to easily find your Sandstorm server on the network and ensure that they are communicating with it securely. Basically, it acts like a phone book. The Sandcats service never sees any of the content of your server nor any of the traffic to your server.</p>

    <section id="terms" onclick="showTerms()">
<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>The following terms apply to your use of the Sandstorm Sandcats DNS service ("the service"), as offered by Sandstorm Development Group, Inc. ("we"/"us").</p>

<p>These terms do NOT apply to any other Sandstorm service, such as Sandstorm Oasis. These terms also do not apply to users running the Sandstorm open source software under their own domain name. Use of the Sandstorm software on your own server (whether under sandcats.io or your own domain) is covered by <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/LICENSE">the Sandstorm license</a>.</p>

<h2>What you may do with the services</h2>

<p>The Sandcats service provides DNS (allowing people to locate your server's IP address given the name you choose for it) and TLS certificates (allowing people to establish a secure (private and authenticated) connection to your server) to people running a Sandstorm server.</p>

<p>You may use the Sandcats service in conjunction with a server running an up-to-date version of Sandstorm. Sandcats is closely integrated with Sandstorm. As the service's protocols may change over time, it is important that you keep your Sandstorm installation up-to-date. We recommend enabling automatic updates, but if you do not, please update within a month of any new release. If your Sandstorm installation becomes out-of-date, or your server is not running Sandstorm at all, the service may cease to function.</p>

<h2>Prohibited activity</h2>

<ul>
<li>You may not use the service for activities that are illegal under United States law.</li>
<li>You may not use the service to facilitate online harassment campaigns, regardless of legality. "Online harassment" means activity meant to threaten, bully, or otherwise maliciously make life difficult for an individual person or class of people, especially (but not limited to) women and minorities.</li>
<li>You may not choose a hostname that is intended to deceive others about the server's content, such as for the purposes of spam, phishing, or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we, in our sole discression, determine that you are using Sandcats in a way that violates these rules, we may stop providing service for your Sandcats subdomain. If we take such an action, we will e-mail you at the address you provided upon registering your subdomain (unless we are prohibited by law from doing so). For minor violations (in our sole judgment), we may notify you in advance to give you a chance to correct the problem before we take action.</p>

<h2>Law Enforcement Actions</h2>

<p>We will only reveal your data to law enforcement when we believe we are legally required to do so, such as by a court order. If this occurs, we will notify you, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.</p>

<h2>Cancellation</h2>

<p>You may end your service at any time by stopping your Sandstorm server or reconfiguring it not to use Sandcats. If you wish for us to explicitly delete your last-known IP address and email address from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sandstorm.io">support@sandstorm.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes to service</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service at any time. If possible we will give 30 days' notice before discontinuing existing functionality.</p>

<h2>Problems and Contact</h2>

<p>All problems should be reported by emailing <a href="mailto:support@sandstorm.io">support@sandstorm.io</a>, except for security problems, which should be reported to <a href="mailto:security@sandstorm.io">security@sandstorm.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>As with any agreement, our lawyers said there are additional provisions necessary to explain our relationship.  Read these carefully.</p>

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NO COMMUNICATION OF ANY KIND BETWEEN YOU AND SANDSTORM OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF SANDSTORM CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY HEREUNDER OR CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS. MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT INCREASE THE MONETARY DAMAGES LIMIT STATED HEREIN.

<h2>Effective Date</h2>

<p>This policy is effective as of October 6, 2015.</p>

    <section id="privacy" onclick="showPrivacy()">
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy describes in detail how the Sandstorm Sandcats DNS service ("the service"), as run by Sandstorm Development Group, Inc. ("we"/"us"), protects your privacy.</p>

<p>This policy does NOT apply to any other Sandstorm service, such as Sandstorm Oasis. These terms also do not apply to users running the Sandstorm open source software under their own domain name. Use of the Sandstorm software on your own server (whether under sandcats.io or your own domain) is covered by <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/LICENSE">the Sandstorm license</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Sandcats service provides DNS (allowing people to locate your computer's IP address given the name you choose for it) and TLS certificates (allowing people to establish a secure (private and authenticated) connection to your server) to people running a Sandstorm server.</p>

<h2>Data gathered from you, and how we use it</h2>

<p>When you run a Sandstorm server that uses Sandcats, the service gathers two pieces of information about you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your server's IP address. This address will be published to the world via the DNS protocol, as is the purpose of the service.</li>
<li>Your email address. We will use this address to contact you with service issues if needed and to help you recover a lost hostname. We will not share this address with anyone unless required by law, in which case we will notify you unless prohibited by law.</li>
<li>Your chosen Sandcats subdomain. Although we do not actively publish a directory of Sandcats hostnames, this name may appear in certificate transparency reports and other public places.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data gathered by other users' servers</h2>

<p>When you visit a subdomain of sandcats.io, you are visiting someone else's server. This server is not controlled by us. You will need to consult that server's own privacy policy to determine how it may use your data.</p>

<h2>Data Storage Location</h2>

<p>All data we collect is stored in the United States on servers at our infrastructure service provider, Google Cloud Services, which stores this data encrypted at rest. Google Cloud Services' <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a>, section 5, states that Google will use data stored through the service only to deliver the service; data will not be used in conjunction with Google's other products, including advertising products.</p>

<h2>Cancellation and data deletion</h2>

<p>You may end your service at any time by stopping your Sandstorm server or reconfiguring it not to use Sandcats. If you wish for us to explicitly delete your last-known IP address and email address from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sandstorm.io">support@sandstorm.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Effective Date</h2>
