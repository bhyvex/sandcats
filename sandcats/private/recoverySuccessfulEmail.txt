Hi there,

I'm a robot running on sandcats.io, helping out with people's domain names.

Someone, hopefully you, just configured a new computer (or at least, a new
key) to be used with your domain, namely:

{{ hostname }}.sandcats.io.


If you have further questions, hit "reply" or send an email to
support@sandstorm.io.

Thanks!
