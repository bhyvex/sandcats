Hi there,

I'm a robot running on sandcats.io, helping out with people's domain names.

Someone told me that you need to recover your domain name, namely
{{ hostname }}.sandcats.io.

You will need the following string:

  {{ recoveryToken }}

This is a token that you can copy-paste into the install script. It allows
you to register a new computer at the same sandcats.io subdomain that you
were using before.

Once you successfully recover the domain, I will send you a fresh email
to say that you did so.

If you have further questions, hit "reply" or send an email to
support@sandstorm.io.

Thanks!
